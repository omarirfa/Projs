# Hybrid Unsupervised Classification Technique for Automatic Brain MRI Tumor Recognition

This folder contains work done on my thesis which can be read in the pdf Khan_OmarIrfan_202001_MSc. The code is designed to automatically classify high grade gliomas (HGG) and low grade gliomas (LGG). Moreover, to differentiate between tumors and normal brains, normal brain MRIs were utilized to show how the algorithm perceives it.
